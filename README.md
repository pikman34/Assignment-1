My project is a recreation of a guitar in godot! It can only play major and minor chords, so no basic string sounds.

Open my project in Godot and press play, once you do so you click the start button and start playing the guitar! Everything is done with mouse clicks so just point and click.

Start menu, Start and Exit buttons, audio sliders for guitar sounds and looping backing track of drums, toggle for major chords and minor chords, and buttons for all the chords that are playable.
